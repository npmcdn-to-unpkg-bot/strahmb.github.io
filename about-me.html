        <h2 class="h1">About Me</h2><p>I’m a masters student studying Human-Centered Design and Development at Purdue University. As a programmer, I first became interested in User Experience Design (<span class="caps">UX</span>) when I realized that there were quality issues or setbacks in development projects that could have been avoided by better user research. As I have focused on UX in my graduate studies and incorporated some of these processes into my work as a developer, I’ve become a big fan of iterative design processes and helping users get involved in design through co-design methods. I value generative and evaluative qualitative research methods, but I’ve also studied quantitative research methods to provide a complementary perspective. In my post-graduate career I would like to work in an environment where I can learn new things and figure out puzzles. I value being able to collaborate with skilled and passionate people, and believe that the best products are designed by close-knit, skilled, cross-functional&nbsp;teams.</p>
