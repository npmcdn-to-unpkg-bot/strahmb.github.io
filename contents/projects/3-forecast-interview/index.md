tagline: Creating a dashboard and notification system to assist with student registration.

Organization: <a href="http://itap.purdue.edu/studio/">Studio by Purdue</a>
Problem: My team was asked to quickly create a mockup for a web-based dashboard and notification system to help students at Purdue University register for their classes on time.
Solution: Our visual designer and I performed five semi-structured interviews with undergraduate students about their current scheduling and registration practices.

## My Role
I led the research for this project and created the final iteration of the mockup.

## Process

### Plan
We needed to learn about student registration experiences, but we only had a few days. Contextual inquiry would let us probe about the pain points in the process as they happen, but registration had closed a couple weeks ago. I proposed we do short **semi-structured interviews** at the Starbucks on campus instead. We wouldn't get the detail of an observation, but we could **learn about past experiences** and **get participants quickly**.

I wrote an interview script that focused on:
- General scheduling habits and artifacts.
- How they got registered for their current classes.
- Their advisor meeting and how they prepared.

### Understand
We interviewed five students for 10-15 minutes each and got a few initial impressions:
- Most of the students used their **phone's calendar** or a **school management app** to keep track of things.
- All the students were **happy with the information from their advisors** and the notifications they got over email.
- A few students rarely checked their school email.
- Classes were filled up very quickly for some majors.  **Email wasn't fast enough** for notifications when registration opened.

### Make
We focused our design around two points:
- Displaying upcoming events.
- Providing reminders through calendar integration and text messages.

## Outcomes
I created the final mockup in Sketch, matching the existing look and feel for the project.  We sent it to our stakeholders, and it was approved for development.
