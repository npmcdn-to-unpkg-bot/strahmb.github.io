### Organization
[Studio by Purdue](http://itap.purdue.edu/studio/)

### Team
- Casey Wright- Team Lead
- Brendan Strahm - Front-end Designer/Developer

### Problem
Users and developers had noted inconsistencies in the design of Passport, a digital badging web application. The team lead asked me to assess possible usability issues.

### Solution
I performed a cognitive walkthrough of the site in order to document issues and possible solutions.

## Research
Resources were not available for doing interviews, card sorts, or usability testing with real users, so proposed that I perform a cognitive walkthrough. This allowed me to document specific ways that user research could benefit the project in the future.

I started by documenting my two major sources of bias:
- I had a close relationship with the developers of Passport and may be hesitant to overly criticize their work.
- Since I had recommended the walkthrough, I would be predisposed to find usability issues in order to justify the assessment.

Next, I went page-by-page through the site and recorded points of confusion, frustration, excitement, or engagement.  The application had a student-facing section and an instructor-facing section, so I did a walkthrough from the perspective of each type of user.

I encountered a few types of issues:
- Text with low contrast
- Poor information scent for new users
- Unexpected layout and styling changes between pages
- Unclear system messages
- Inconsistent styling on pages

## Outcomes
My final report included documentation of the issues and strong points I encountered in the walkthrough.  I also recommended performing an open-ended card sort to improve the structure of the site.
