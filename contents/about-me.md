Iâ€™m a Masters student in **Human-Centered Design and Development** at **Purdue University** and currently living in West Lafayette, IN with my wife, Jenna, and our dog, Daisy. When I'm not working on co-design research for my thesis, I'm probably hiking, camping, swing dancing, or hanging out with family and friends.

I believe that user research is an essential part of making great products at scale. I've seen the chaos that can happen when teams make design decisions without good research, and I want to help provide that foundation. I've studied **qualitative research methods**, **design**, and **programming**, so I can communicate effectively with a wide variety of people and wear multiple hats when I need to.

I'm always interested in meeting new people, so shoot me an email at bstrahm [at] gmail.com or say hi on Twitter at [@strahmb](https://twitter.com/strahmb).
