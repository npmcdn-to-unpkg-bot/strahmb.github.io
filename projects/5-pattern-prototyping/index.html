<h3 id="problem">Problem</h3>
<p>Students using Pattern, a student time-tracking platform on web and mobile, had provided feedback that it took too long to enter data about their study habits. I was asked to create a prototype of a better data entry&nbsp;workflow.</p>
<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>
<p>I used multiple iterations of feedback to create and refine a prototype&nbsp;design.</p>
<h2 id="research">Research</h2>
<p>I started by researching how other apps handled similar data entry tasks, and drew some inspiration from calendars. I got feedback from the visual designer and product manager, and then began creating prototypes in&nbsp;Proto.io.  </p>
<p>While my initial prototypes were closer to a traditional mobile calendar interface, the long presses and dragging in this interface were found to be cumbersome in hallway usability tests.  I eventually iterated to a design that focused on each data point in isolation and used smart defaults to possibly avoid the need for any additional&nbsp;interaction.</p>
<p>The final design reduced the number of clicks needed to enter data. It used smart defaults for the entry fields, better date and time inputs for web, iOS, and Android, and a streamlined entry&nbsp;flow.</p>

<h2 id="outcomes">Outcomes</h2>
<p>The final prototype was approved by my manager and I implemented it into our Angular-based web app and consulted on its implementation on iOS and&nbsp;Android.</p>
<p>This project took place when I was still trying to figure out how to be a <span class="caps">UX</span> advocate in an environment that didnâ€™t have good practices in place.  In retrospect, I should have done usability tests with students throughout the iteration process either in addition to or instead of the hallway ones.  This project is one that prompted me to learn how to talk about the value of UX practices in terms of business outcomes and not just best&nbsp;practices.</p>
