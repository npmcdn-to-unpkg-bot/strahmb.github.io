            </p><h2 id="methodology">Methodology</h2>
<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>I researched existing methods for eliciting design insights and current trends of onboarding experience design. Then I proposed an <strong>iterative, 3-step research protocol</strong> based around&nbsp;co-design:</p>
<ol>
<li>A <strong>short interview</strong> helps researchers learn more about the participant’s attitudes and prior experiences related to&nbsp;onboarding.</li>
<li>A <strong>think-aloud session</strong> performing tasks with a prototype of the app creates a lived experience of using and learning about the&nbsp;app.</li>
<li>A <strong><a href="http://pro.sagepub.com/content/37/4/295.short"><span class="caps">CARD</span> co-design session</a></strong> allows the researcher and participant to improve that experience by representing it as a line of cards and reorganizing it to remove&nbsp;issues.</li>
</ol>

            <img src="/projects/1-thesis/thesis-process.jpg" alt="Do the study with a no onboarding group, then make onboarding and do it again.  I&#39;ll compare time-on-task and error rates between the two.">

<p>I’m going to do <strong>two iterations</strong> of the protocol to validate it for my thesis research, but it can be run as many times as is&nbsp;needed.</p>
<h3 id="my-card-variant">My <span class="caps">CARD</span>&nbsp;Variant</h3>
<p>My major contribution was a variant of the <span class="caps">CARD</span> method for evaluating onboarding flows. It was designed to allow participants to leverage their lived experience using the app without getting bogged down in the details of interface&nbsp;design.</p>
<p>The variant used six types of <strong>cards to represent events</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Setting a&nbsp;goal</li>
<li>Completing a&nbsp;goal</li>
<li>Learning something&nbsp;new</li>
<li>Evaluating&nbsp;something</li>
<li>Positive&nbsp;reaction</li>
<li>Negative&nbsp;reaction</li>
</ol>
<p>Each card has a few examples and a space to write specific&nbsp;details.</p>
<p>Researcher and participant <strong>review the recording</strong> of the think-aloud session and <strong>lay cards down in a line</strong> to match the events in the recording. Then they look for patterns where the participant ran into problems and try to remove and reorder the cards to provide a better&nbsp;experience.</p>

<h3 id="theoretical-framing">Theoretical&nbsp;Framing</h3>
<p>I used <strong>phenomenology</strong> and <strong>constructivism</strong> as lenses to look at my research&nbsp;area.</p>
<p>Phenomenology explores people’s lived experiences of events or interactions. That focused my work on <strong>people’s interactions with mobile onboarding</strong> and not their opinions or something about the interfaces&nbsp;themselves.</p>
<p>Constructivism deals with finding meaning. It states that meaning is created dynamically when people interact with things, so I needed to investigate <strong>during an interaction and immediately afterwards</strong> to see how people learned to use the interface and what parts they cared&nbsp;about.</p>
<h3 id="minimalist-instruction">Minimalist&nbsp;Instruction</h3>
<p>My methodology was inspired by <strong>John Carroll</strong>’s work at the <span class="caps">IBM</span> Watson Research Center in the 80’s and 90’s. He was trying to help people transition to desktop computers before many interaction design practices were established. Carroll believed that it was impossible to create good instructions on the first try, so he stressed the importance of <strong>iterative design</strong> and <strong>learning from your participants</strong>. I tried to preserve the spirit of his research in my&nbsp;protocol.</p>
<p>You can read more about Carroll’s work on <a href="http://www.instructionaldesign.org/theories/minimalism.html">InstructionalDesign.org</a> and about minimalism in general on <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/roots-minimalism-web-design/"><span class="caps">NN</span>/g</a>.</p>
<h3 id="the-card-method">The <span class="caps">CARD</span>&nbsp;Method</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://pro.sagepub.com/content/37/4/295.short"><span class="caps">CARD</span> method</a> was created by Tudor and Mueller at Bell Labs in the 90’s. It is a participatory task analysis and redesign method that uses cards to abstract the steps in task flows. Working with cards instead of interfaces helps users work at a comfortable level of&nbsp;abstraction.</p>
