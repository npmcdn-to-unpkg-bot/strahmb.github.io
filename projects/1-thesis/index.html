        <h2 class="h1">Masters Thesis</h2><p class="note">I’m currently in the middle of my masters research, so this section is still in progress.  I’ve completed the literature review and methodology, but I’m waiting on the paperwork to go through before I can begin data&nbsp;collection.</p>

<h3 id="problem">Problem</h3>
<p>My overall research goal is to explore methods for designing mobile in-app onboarding experiences, which teach new users how to use the&nbsp;app.</p>
<h3 id="research-question">Research&nbsp;Question</h3>
<p>How can designers elicit users’ lived experiences of learning an&nbsp;app?</p>
<h2 id="methodology">Methodology</h2>
<p>I researched existing methods for eliciting design insights and current trends of onboarding experience design. Then I proposed an iterative, 3-step research protocol based around&nbsp;co-design:</p>
<ul>
<li>A short interview helps researchers learn more about the participant’s attitudes and prior experiences related to&nbsp;onboarding.</li>
<li>A think-aloud session performing tasks with a prototype of the app creates a lived experience using and learning about the&nbsp;app.</li>
<li>A <span class="caps">CARD</span> co-design session allows the researcher and participant to improve the experience in the think-aloud by representing and modifying it using cards to represent types of&nbsp;events.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="research-highlights">Research&nbsp;Highlights</h2>
<h3 id="framing-the-problem">Framing the&nbsp;problem</h3>
<p>In order to understand the problem better, I had to find some good theories to be a lens for my inquiry.  Since my focus was on understanding more about people’s’ experiences learning to use mobile apps, I started off by taking a phenomenological perspective.  Building on that, constructivism states that the meaning of an artifact isn’t a static thing that you can find through looking at the artifact itself–it is created by a person as they use the artifact.  For me, this meant that in order to elicit design insights about onboarding, I had to focus on people’s lived experiences while they first used the&nbsp;app.</p>
<h3 id="minimalist-instruction">Minimalist&nbsp;instruction</h3>
<p>Much of my inspiration on a more practical level came from John Carroll’s work at <span class="caps">IBM</span> in the 70’s and 80’s.  He was trying to help people transition to desktop computers before many interface conventions and interaction design practices were established, and he developed an approach for nonlinear goal-driven instruction manuals that has had effects on interface design including being the ‘minimalism’ in Nielsen’s heuristic of ‘Aesthetics and Minimalist design.’  Carroll stressed what was essentially a constructivist iterative approach to designing instruction, as he believed that it was impossible to create adequate instructions on the first try.  I tried to preserve the spirit of his research in my&nbsp;approach.</p>
<h3 id="the-card-method-and-my-variant">The <span class="caps">CARD</span> method, and my&nbsp;variant</h3>
<p>While interviews and think-aloud sessions are common tools for <span class="caps">UX</span> professionals, the CARD co-design method is less known.  Designed by Tudor and Mueller at Bell Labs in the 90’s, this participatory task analysis and redesign method uses cards to abstract the steps in task flows so users can work at a comfortable level of abstraction.  My variation uses cards based on Carroll’s work: setting or completing a goal, learning something new, evaluating something, or having a positive or negative reaction to something.  Researcher and participant lay these cards out in a line to represent an experience using the app.  Then they look for patterns where the participant ran into problems and try to remove and reorder the cards to provide a better experience.  This allows for participants to leverage their lived experience using the app to design a smoother onboarding experience without getting bogged down in its&nbsp;implementation.</p>
