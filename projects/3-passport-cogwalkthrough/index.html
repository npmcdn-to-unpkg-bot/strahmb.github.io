<h3 id="problem">Problem</h3>
<p>Users and developers had noted inconsistencies in the design of Passport, a digital badging web application. The team lead asked me to assess possible usability&nbsp;issues.</p>
<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>
<p>I performed a cognitive walkthrough of the site in order to document issues and possible&nbsp;solutions.</p>
<h2 id="research">Research</h2>
<p>Resources were not available for doing interviews, card sorts, or usability testing with real users, so proposed that I perform a cognitive walkthrough. This allowed me to document specific ways that user research could benefit the project in the&nbsp;future.</p>
<p>I started by documenting my two major sources of&nbsp;bias:</p>
<ul>
<li>I had a close relationship with the developers of Passport and may be hesitant to overly criticize their&nbsp;work.</li>
<li>Since I had recommended the walkthrough, I would be predisposed to find usability issues in order to justify the&nbsp;assessment.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next, I went page-by-page through the site and recorded points of confusion, frustration, excitement, or engagement.  The application had a student-facing section and an instructor-facing section, so I did a walkthrough from the perspective of each type of&nbsp;user.</p>
<p>I encountered a few types of&nbsp;issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Text with low&nbsp;contrast</li>
<li>Poor information scent for new&nbsp;users</li>
<li>Unexpected layout and styling changes between&nbsp;pages</li>
<li>Unclear system&nbsp;messages</li>
<li>Inconsistent styling on&nbsp;pages</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="outcomes">Outcomes</h2>
<p>My final report included documentation of the issues and strong points I encountered in the walkthrough.  I also recommended performing an open-ended card sort to improve the structure of the&nbsp;site.</p>
