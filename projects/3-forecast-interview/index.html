<h3 id="problem">Problem</h3>
<p>My team was asked to quickly create a mockup for a web-based dashboard and notification system to help students at Purdue University register for their classes on&nbsp;time.</p>
<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>
<p>Michele and I performed five semi-structured interviews with undergraduate students about their current scheduling and registration&nbsp;practices.</p>
<h2 id="research">Research</h2>
<p>My first choice of using contextual inquiry wasn’t an option because of logistical barriers.  I proposed we do short interviews instead at the Starbucks on campus. I wrote up a semi-structured script focusing on students’ existing scheduling practices and artifacts. We asked about how they manage their schedule, their process for registering for their current classes, and what they talk about with their academic&nbsp;advisors.</p>
<p>We came away from the interviews with a few initial&nbsp;impressions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Calendar-type apps were the most common way students kept track of their&nbsp;schedules.</li>
<li>Students were happy with the information from their advisors and the notifications they got over&nbsp;email.</li>
<li>Some students rarely checked their school&nbsp;email.</li>
<li>Email notifications weren’t useful for time-sensitive notifications like when students’ time tickets opened.  They would prefer something like text&nbsp;messages.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="outcomes">Outcomes</h2>
<p>We focused our design around two points:
Displaying upcoming events.
Providing reminders through calendar integration and text messages.
Our visual designer turned the best ideas from our sketches into a hi-fi mockup to send to our stakeholders. The design was approved for&nbsp;development.</p>
